# CSS To-do-list
## A to-do-list, using only CSS?
Functional and interactive (except adding/removing items) To-Do-List, using only CSS.

The HTML file was already provided and I was supposed to be able to:
* Click items to mark them as done,
* Click again to revert to pending,
* Display counters next to the headings with the number of done and pending items respectively,
* Make done items appear under the "Done" heading and pending under "Pending".

Requirements:
* Use modular CSS,
* Use a sensible naming convention for CSS classes,
* Make sure it works the same way in both Firefox and Chrome (latest versions).

I was allowed to:
* Use SASS,
* Use any CSS properties,
* Add/rename/remove CSS classes and ID's,
* Add/rephrase/remove text content and list items.

_I was not allowed to:_
* Change the HTML structure,
* Use JavaScript.
